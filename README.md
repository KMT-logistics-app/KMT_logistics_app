# KMT_logistics_app

## Description:
The application will be used by employees of a large Australian company aiming to expand its activities to the freight industry. The app will be used to manage the delivery of packages between hubs in major Australian cities. An employee of the company is able to record the details of a delivery package, create or search for suitable delivery routes, and inspect the current state of delivery packages, transport vehicles and delivery routes.

## What is the work flow:

1. Employee accepts the package from a customer and creates it in the application.
2. He/She check if there is a suitable route for it.
3. If there is a route, the employee adds the package to the route.
4. If there's not, he/she search for the nearest free truck.
5. If the truck is not at the same city, the employee calculates the kilometers and the time for relocation of the truck.
6. Ð¢he route is created based on the information gathered above.
7. The employee assigns the truck and packages to the route.
8. To the routes can be assigned many packages but only one truck.
9. The capacity for the packages in the route is based on the truck load capacity. If the employye tries to assign package which weight is bigger than the capacity left, new route has to be created.
